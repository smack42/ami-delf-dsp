delfinampeg.device CHANGES


1.6 (Sat 17-May-2003)
    -main processing now in SoftInterrupt instead of Delfina hardware IRQ
     (less interference with timing-critical activities like Serial I/O)


1.5 (Sun 03-Nov-2002)
    -mp3 decoder:
      -synthesis - corrected output level
      -huffman/scaling - reorder short blocks only (less memory)
      -scaling - skip zero scalefactor bands (tiny speedup)
    -mp2 decoder:
      -synthesis - corrected output level


1.4 (Fri 04-Jan-2002)
    -mp3 decoder: tiny speedup (further optimized huffman decoding)
    -device API: fixed NSCMD_DEVICEQUERY (list of supported commands)


1.3 (Thu 14-Jun-2001)
    -little code optimizing
    -fixed a quite unobvious bug in the cleanupDelfina() routine
     this avoids the "noisy deadlock" when seeking inside a file in AMPlifier
     using delfina.library 4.14 (personally, I can tolerate the "fake crash"
     bug of 4.14 but I *hate* the "sudden freeze" problem of the 4.16ß libs)


1.2 (Tue 17-Apr-2001)
    -little code polishing (not performance-relevant)
    -minor API function fixes:
      -CMD_RESET implemented (had completely forgotten it...)
       now it does: set volume to 100%, clear Pause state and CMD_FLUSH
      -CMD_WRITE now returns values in io_Actual and io_Error
       (applications could check io_Error to find out if the sound was really
       played. for instance, unrecognized stream data (everything other than
       MPEG-1 audio) results in io_Error=MPEGERR_CMD_FAILED)
       

1.1 (Sat 07-Apr-2001)
    -mp3 decoder:
      -fixed a bug which had caused minor distortions
      -implemented INTENSITY STEREO decoding (at last)
    -added configuration options (ENV-variable DELFINAMPEG)


1.0 (Sat 04-Nov-2000)  release
    -much safer MPEG frame header recognition
     (no more noise or crashes when seeking inside a file with AMPlifier)
    -added separate volume left/right handling (balance)


1.0 (Sun 29-Oct-2000)  BETA
