DelfMPEG CHANGES


1.0 (Sat 17-May-2003)
    -main processing now in SoftInterrupt instead of Delfina hardware IRQ
     (less interference with timing-critical activities like Serial I/O)
    -recognition of the new Delfina Flipper board (shown in VERBOSE mode)
    -OUTFILEINTEL option added (write decoded data to a file - Intel byteorder)


0.9 (Tue 29-Oct-2002)
    -mp3 decoder:
      -synthesis - corrected output level
      -huffman/scaling - reorder short blocks only (less memory)
      -scaling - skip zero scalefactor bands (tiny speedup)
    -mp2 decoder:
      -synthesis - corrected output level
    -OUTFILE option added (write decoded data to a file)


0.8 (Sun 28-Oct-2001)
    -mp3 decoder:
      -tiny speedup (further optimized huffman decoding)
    -file reader:
      -added playlist interpreter
       (if a file is not recognized as MPEG-1 audio then it is interpreted
       as a playlist file: one file name per line; comment lines beginning
       with a '#' character are ignored.  this playlist format is generated
       by popular player programs like AMPlifier, Winamp (*.m3u), etc.)


0.7 (Sat 07-Apr-2001)
    -mp3 decoder:
      -fixed a bug which had caused minor distortions
       it was there from the very beginning - nobody ever noticed it??!!
      -implemented INTENSITY STEREO decoding (at last)


0.6 (Thu 27-Jul-2000)
    -file reader:
      -fixed a bug in the RIFF header recognition
    -implemented ARexx interface (AREXX/S option added)


0.5 (Sat 08-Jul-2000)
    -file reader:
      -RIFF header recognition added
       (for all guys out there using W*nd*ws encoders)
      -better handling of unknown data at the beginning of files
       (now it should recognize more files with strange headers)


0.4 (Tue 16-May-2000)
    -mp3 decoder:
      -significant speedup!
       (synthesis, hybrid filter and huffman routines optimized)
      -bit reservoir handling (performed by the 68K CPU) is now done after
       calling the DSP decoding routine. this reduces latency time of the
       interrrupt server, indirectly resulting in another little speedup.
    -mp2 decoder:
      -speedup (synthesis routine optimized)
    -file reader:
      -bugfix: SHOWTAG option caused problems for files with ID3v2 tag
      -better sanity check (frame headers) and error report
      -resync feature and STRICT/S option added
      -Xing VBR header recognition added (info for Variable BitRate files)
    -DACRATE/K/N option added
    -VOLUME/K/N option added


0.3 (Sun 09-Apr-2000)
    -mp3 decoder implemented:
      -yes, finally it's here!
       hello to the people who said this would be impossible. ;)
       thanks to all who supported me with their ideas and source codes.
      -INTENSITY STEREO decoding is not implemented yet...
    -mp2 decoder improved:
      -subband synthesis routine optimized
       (slightly faster and shorter code, using more internal P-memory)
      -using more internal L-memory for a little speedup
      -fixed the "low-bitrate streams sounded really strange" bug
      -playback quality slightly improved
       (fixed the little known "intermediate ZERO-bitalloc" bug, which
       could have resulted in some (hardly audible) distortions)
    -MPEG file reader improved:
      -FRAMEBUF/K/N and ASYNCBUF/K/N options added
       (user controls for allocation of buffer memory)
      -read error detection added (eg. unexpected end of file)
      -ID3v2 tag recognition added (for now they are simply skipped)
    -DECODER_BUSY detection added (prevent DSP overload)
    -fast forward (Ctrl-F) feature and FFSKIP/K/N option added
    -position timer output and NOTIMER/S option added
    -MONO/S option added (force mono decoding - significant speedup)


0.2 (Wed 27-Oct-1999)
    -MPEG file reader improved:
      -detect MPEG1 sync word only (reject MPEG2 and MPEG2.5 files)
      -check frameheader changes (layer and sampling freq must be constant)
      -play already buffered data in case of read error (force EOF)
    -unsupported files (i.e. other than layer II) are skipped
    -NOPLAY/S doesn't open delfina.library (it's not required for this)
    -SHOWTAG/S feature added (display ID3v1 tag before playing)
    -NOFASTL/S and NOFASTP/S options added
     (user controls for allocation of the FAST internal DSP memory;
     the nasty deadlocks/crashes with AHI disappear when using NOFASTP!!)
    -changed license terms to GNU General Public License

    -mp2 decoder: little speedup (using more internal DSP memory)
    -mp2 decoder: fixed mono bug
