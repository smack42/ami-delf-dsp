DelfMPEG 0.6 ARexx doc
(Thu 27-Jul-2000)


DelfMPEG can operate in two different modes:
-interactive mode
  (play files that were specified by the FILES command line option or
  selected using the reqtools requester)
-ARexx mode
  (activated by the AREXX command line option; the program is controlled
  via the ARexx commands listed below)


To get DelfMPEG into ARexx mode just specify the AREXX command line option,
together with the other options you want to use.
Only one instance of DelfMPEG can run in ARexx mode at the same time.

examples:
DelfMPEG AREXX VERBOSE SHOWTAG
  (gives you a lot of output, including all received ARexx commands)

DelfMPEG >NIL: AREXX SHOWTAG
  (no output at all)



ARexx commands  -  port name 'DELFMPEG'



QUIT
    quit program

PLAY <filename>
    play the specified file; this command only works if the player had been
    stopped before, during playback the PLAY command is simply ignored

STOP
    stop playback; it's usually a good idea to use STOP before PLAY

PAUSE
    pause playback; can also be used before PLAY command (when the player is
    stopped), the next PLAY will initialize the file reader without starting
    playback, you can use the GET... commands to get some file info and later
    use CONTINUE to start playback

CONTINUE
    continue playback after PAUSE command

SETVOLUME <number>
    set playback volume (in per cent; range 0...200)
    this command always works, even before PLAY; please note that values
    higher than 100 might cause distortions due to output clipping (you'd
    better use the controls of your amplifier to boost the volume)

SETPOSITION <seconds>
    set playback position inside the file that's currently playing; this
    command works in PLAY and PAUSE mode, but not in STOP mode
    **NOTE: this doesn't work if the STRICT command line option is specified!

GETSTATUS
    get program status code:
    0  - player stopped (after STOP command or when playback is finished)
    1  - playing (after PLAY and/or CONTINUE command)
    2  - player paused (after PAUSE command)
    10 - error: initDelfina failed
    20 - error: file not found
    30 - error: file not recognized as MPEG1 audio
    (if an error occurs then the player automatically returns to STOP mode)

GETFILENAME
    get file name (was set by a PLAY command before)

GETFILETYPE
    get file type information (MPEG layer, bit rate, sampling rate, channels);
    this is the same string that DelfMPEG also prints to stdout

GETDURATION
    get total playback duration of the file (in seconds)

GETPOSITION
    get current playback position in the file (in seconds)
    **NOTE: this doesn't work if the NOTIMER command line option is specified!

GETTITLE
GETARTIST
GETALBUM
GETCOMMENT
GETYEAR
GETGENRE
    get ID3v1 tag information; the returned strings will be empty if the info
    is not available; GETGENRE returns the genre number (e.g. 17 for 'Rock')
    **NOTE: you need to specify the SHOWTAG command line option for this!
